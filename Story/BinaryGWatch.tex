\section{BinaryGWatch}
\subsection{PCB}
The PCB is based on the Binary Watch. Even the Buttons would still work if soldered on the board. Additionally to the original Schematics there is a Bosch BMA456 connected to the SPI, which is already on the back of the PCB to enable programming via Pogo Pins. Additionally there is also the Chip select pin used and two interrupt pins to enable the wakeup functionality via the BMA sensor

The BMA Sensor is mounted on the back of the PCB to keep the symetric watch face. 

The concept is to use the BMA Sensor also as interface. To enable the Display and also to set the time. So no buttons will be needed this should also enable a housing without holes to keep sweat from crawling into and solve the corroded PCB problems I had with the first BinaryWatch
