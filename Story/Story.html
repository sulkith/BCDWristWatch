<!--l. 30--><p class="noindent" >The First PCB Version was a desaster. The PCBs arrived very fast, but the QFN Package had the
wrong size. ATMEL only produces QFN32 in 7x7mm. Therefore the design of the PCB hat to be
changed to the smaller package, but that gave me the Chance to shrink the Design to a smaller form
factor. The part which keeps the PCB from getting smaller is the Coin Cell Battery (CR2032). On the
PCBs there was the order number printed on the Front side, which would be visble in the final
assembly.

<!--l. 37--><p class="noindent" >The second PCB Version was designed from scratch. But the Front was the side with the Battery, so
hopefully the Order Number would not be printed on the visible side of the PCB. This worked out
very well for the second Version of the PCBs.

with some Cables soldered to the Testpins on the Backside of the Board. And the Battery case
was also not assembled. Here is a Picture of the uncleaned but already soldered PCB

to arrive(to Germany).&#x00A0;The PCB was not completely milled out. It was in a carrier PCB
with rectangular shape, but it was easy to remove.&#x00A0;I had to sand the edges a bit, since
it was a bit rough on the parts where i removed the connections to the carrier, since i
had to sand the PCB anyway to fit in the Housing that was no big problem.&#x00A0;The overall
Quality of the PCBs is very good, but you can not choose the thicknes or color of the
PCB.&#x00A0;</p>

<!--l. 67--><p class="noindent" >After the PCBs for the BCD Version were working, i also created an analog Version, so i dont have to
explain the Clock everytime ;-)
</p><!--l. 69--><p class="indent" >   The Analog Watch features the same Schematics for the basic clock functionality, but the display
is done via Charlieplexing the LEDs. There are 4 Clustes with 4 Pins which drive all the 42 LEDs. 12
LEDs on the inner ring are displaying the hours. On the outer ring 30 LEDs display the Minutes.
Since it was not possible to fit 60 LEDs on the outer ring, uneven numbers are shown while lighting
up the two neighbouring LEDs. </p>

<!--l. 80--><p class="noindent" >The Housing was printed by the TOOM Printing Service as SLS in PLA.&#x00A0;Sadly all the surfaces are
not really smooth, therefore the Buttons are working very bad.&#x00A0;I tried to glue in the glass with
superglue, but the glue dried out white, this looks really bad :-(&#x00A0;

needed, since the resin could be used.

<!--l. 88--><p class="noindent" >It turns out, that there is no completely transparent Resin available. All of them get a yellow color
sooner or later. So it is not really beautiful as a glass.

 id="x1-120003.3"></a>Housing 2</h4>
<!--l. 92--><p class="noindent" >A friend told me that most of the time the resin will not reflect light equally in every spot, therefore i
decided to order a PCB without glass and do the mounting of the glass with very tight tolerances and
a rim on the top edge.&#x00A0;this worked out extremely well.&#x00A0;Another goal was to make the second Housing
slim, because the first one was very bulky. With a bit of optimization is was possible to integrate the
bottom plate completely in the housing. The overall thicknes was reduced from about 15mm to
9.4mm with the 1mm PCB or 10mm with the new 1.6mm PCB.&#x00A0;For the PCB to tightly fit in
either the Housing has to get some aditional holes or at least the Battery clip has to be
modified.&#x00A0;</p>

the housing and the lid.&#x00A0;That worked out a little bit better, but the Watch also stopped working after

<!--l. 114--><p class="noindent" >After analyzing it again the PCB seemd to be ok. The PCB was only a little damaged from the first
sweat attack. The Problem was that the time stopped to run, but another point was that the LEDs
wont go off anymore. But it was possible to set the time. So the conclusion is that the clock which is
run by the crystal stopped running.

covered. This is an attempt to stop moisture from crawling below the crystal and stopping the clock.
